\begin{abstract}

Today's web is secured with SSL and TLS, which utilizes RSA to create secure
connections between servers and users. To ensure that the users are
communicating with the web server they intend and not someone masquerading as
the server, Certificate Authorities (CAs) are considered to be secure trusted
parties that can confirm the identity of the server. While better than a
completely insecure protocol, CAs can be compromised with Man-in-the-Middle
(MitM) attacks and leave users vulnerable. In an effort to fix this weaknesses
in the CA, The Perspectives Project uses a constellation of notary servers
spread out across the Internet to monitor the SSL certificate signatures over
time. Users install a Firefox extension that compares the signature of the
certificate given to them from the server to the certificates observed by the
notaries. Our augmentation to the Perspectives system allows web servers
currently being monitored by a number of notaries to send a message to each of
these notaries when the server changes their SSL certificate. This mitigates
the lag between the certificate change and observation and therefore protects
the users more efficiently.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

In the modern world the Internet holds a very important role in commerce and
social aspects of life and both of these pursuits require the ability for two
or more parties to communicate securely. To facilitate this secure
communication, the Internet has resorted to using the SSL (Secure Socket Layer)
and it successor TLS (Transport Security Layer) to protect the data being
exchanged.  These protocols utilize public-private key pairs to facilitate RSA
encryption.  While this protocol has been extremely successful it must rely on
a Certificate Authority (CA) to confirm the identity of the owner of public
keys. While it is possible to create `self-signed' certificates, browsers will
warn users if a site uses one of these certificate since it is impossible to
verify who created the certificate. 

Certificate Authorities are points in a network that issues and manages
security credentials and public keys for message encryption. CAs have been
compromised in the past resulting in successful impersonations of several
popular, high profile websites.  In 2011 the central authority Comodo Group,
Inc. was hacked. The attack was easily executed because of Comodo's extremely
weak password system that was easily broken with a word list. The hacker made
off with the SSL certificates for various sites including Gmail, Yahoo Mail,
Hotmail.  \citep{comodohack} This allowed the hacker to perform
Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks on these sites by impersonation the CAs for
the various websites. It allowed the hacker to trick the site user's computers
into believing the fake SSL certificates were genuine and the hacker was then
able to read the site user's emails.  This illustrates the vulnerability in the
SSL protocol that central authorities create.

This vulnerability is what the Perspectives Project sets out to fix. Their
solution to removing central authorities is to create trusted services known as
notaries. These notaries work in tandem with a browser extension that allows
the user of the extension to select which of the notaries they would like to
trust. The system works by checking the SSL certificate signature the user is
given from the server against the SSL certificate signatures that the user's
trusted notaries have in their databases. If there is a discrepancy between the
certificate signature that the server has returned and the signatures that the
notaries have on record, the SSL connection is aborted.

\section{Method}
\label{Method}

For our project we attempted to build upon the Perspective Project by allowing
servers to send messages to notaries requesting that each notary acknowledge
the change of the SSL certificate. This fixes the problem in the Perspectives
Project that can occur when a server changes its SSL certificate and a user
queries the notary for that server's SSL certificate. Because the notary has
not yet updated its record of the SSL certificate the notary reports to the
user that there is a mismatch which may lead the user to abort their attempt to
create an SSL connection.

For a server notify Perspectives notary it must first know that the notary
exists. Since the notary presents itself as a normal user of the site when
performing it probing the server has no idea which of the users it much send a
probe request to when it changes it's certificate. Because of this short time
frame we had to work within, we hard coded the address of the notary that the
server would inform when it changed it's SSL certificate.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 4cm, auto]
    \node[server](server){Server};
    \node[notary, right of=server](note){Notary};
    \node[user, below of=server](user){User};
    \path[double](note) -- node {Notary Queries \& Replies}(user);
    \path[double](user) -- node {Normal SSL connection}(server);
    \path[single](note) -- node {Probing}(server);
    \path[->](server) edge[very thick, bend left=10] node{Probe Request}(note);
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Our modified perspective notary allows for the server to request that
    it's SSL certificate be probed and updated in the Notaries Database.}
\end{figure}

\section{Results}
\label{results}

Our augmentation of the Perspectives system helps protect users by creating a
method to keep Notaries more up to date, which allows the system to do a better
job of validating signatures by reducing the false negative rate. This tendency
for Notaries to incorrectly refute a site's SSL certificate signature because
it is slow to update it's records is an issue with the current Perspectives
implementation. By adding the mechanisms to create notary aware servers, we
have improved the integrity of the system.

Our testing was confined to a single web server and two notary servers. Our
results were positive, updating the notary servers within seconds or receiving
a probe request. It is hard to directly compare this to characteristics of the
original Notaries because each notary updates itself on a schedule. If a Notary
probes it's known sites once every day (as the documentation recommends), and
the server changes it's SSL certificate shortly after it is probed the Notary
could be reporting the wrong certificate for up to a full day. When comparing
several hours to several seconds, it becomes clear how creating Notary aware
servers is a great benefit for the integrity of the system.

\section{Further Work}
\label{further work}

\subsection{Have notaries identify themselves to servers}

It would be very beneficial for notaries be able to inform servers that they
Perspectives notaries. This would allow servers to keep track of notaries that
have a record of them in their database so that when they do make a change to
their SSL certificate they can strive that inform all of the notaries that have
their old certificate so that it can be updated.

\subsection{Add preventive measures against DOS}

Since it is relatively computationally expensive for the notary to probe a
server for a SSL certificate signature it is possible to use these requests to
make a particular notary unresponsive to user queries. This could allow an
attacker to perform a man in the middle attack by rendering all of a users
notaries unresponsive before beginning their attack. While it may be possible
to prevent this attack on the part of the user by not continuing with the SSL
connection when none of their trusted notaries respond, This would still be
undesirable since it would prevent the user from making any secure connections.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item {Only probe a server when the probe request comes from the server itself}

        By only probing a server when the request comes from the server itself
        the possibility of external abuse is extremely limited. This method may
        be hard to implement in practise because it is possible for the
        attackers to spoof the origin of probe request to be the IP of the
        server.

    \item {Rate limit probe requests}

        By only allowing a certain number of probe requests in a period of time
        the notary can ensure that it does not compromise it's ability to
        respond to user request. This a common DOS prevention technique because
        of how effective it is, however it is possible that this method would
        become swamped at certain times since many websites change their SSL
        certificate at times of low traffic (e.g. 3AM).
