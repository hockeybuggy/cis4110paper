\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}

In the modern world the Internet holds a very important role in commerce and
social aspects of life. Both of these pursuits require the ability for two or
more parties to communicate securely. To facilitate this secure communication,
the Internet has resorted to using the SSL (Secure Socket Layer) and it
successor TLS (Transport Security Layer) to protect the data being exchanged.
These protocols utilize public-private key pairs to facilitate RSA encryption.
While this protocol has been extremely successful it must rely on a central
authority to confirm the identity of the owner of public keys. This central
authority is a single point of failure in this authentication system, and has
in the past been compromised, allowing successful impersonation of several
popular, high profile websites.

In 2011 the central authority Comodo Group, Inc. was hacked and the hacker made
off with a SSL certificates for various sites including Gmail, Yahoo Mail,
Hotmail.  \citep{comodohack} This would allow the hacker to preform man in the
middle attacks on the sites and read the emails of users of these services. The
attack was easily executed because of Comodo's extremely weak password that was
easily broken with a word list. This illustrates the vulnerability in the SSL
protocol that central authorities create.

This is vulnerability is what the Perspectives project set out to fix. Their
solution to removing central authorities is to create trusted services known as
notaries. These notaries work in tandem with a browser extension that allows
users of the extension to select which of the notaries they would like to
trust. The system works by checking the SSL certificate signature that they are
given from the server against the SSL certificates signatures that the users
trusted notaries have in their databases. If there is a discrepancy between the
certificate signature that the server has returned and the signatures that the
notaries have on record, the SSL connection is aborted.

    \path[single](note) -- node {Probing}(server);
\end{tikzpicture}

\section{Method}
\label{Method}

For our project we attempted to build upon the Perspective Project by allowing
servers to send messages to notaries requesting that the notary make note of
the change of SSL certificate. This fixes the problem in the perspectives
project that can occur when a server changes it's SSL certificate and a user
queries the notary for that server's SSL certificate. Because the notary has
not yet updated it's record of the SSL certificate and reports to the user that
there is a mismatch which may lead the user to abort their attempt to create an
SSL connection.

For a server notify Perspectives notary it must first know that the notary
exists. Since the notary presents itself as a normal user of the site when
performing it probing the server has no idea which of the users it much send a
probe request to when it changes it's certificate. Because of this short time
frame we had to work within, we hard coded the address of the notary that the
server would inform when it changed it's SSL certificate.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{tikzpicture}[node distance = 4cm, auto]
    \node[server](server){Server};
    \node[notary, right of=server](note){Notary};
    \node[user, below of=server](user){User};
    \path[double](note) -- node {Notary Queries \& Replies}(user);
    \path[double](user) -- node {Normal SSL connection}(server);
    \path[single](note) -- node {Probing}(server);
    \path[->](server) edge[very thick, bend left=10] node{Probe Request}(note);
\end{tikzpicture}
\caption{Our modified perspective notary allows for the server to request that
    it's SSL certificate be probed and updated in the Notaries Database.}

\section{Further Work}
\label{further work}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{Have notaries identify themselves to servers}

    I would be very beneficial for notaries be able to inform servers that they
    Perspectives notaries. This would allow servers to keep track of notaries
    that have a record of them in their database so that when they do make a
    change to their SSL certificate they can strive that inform all of the
    notaries that have their old certificate so that it can be updated.

\end{enumerate}
