## Dependencies

- pdflatex

If you don't have it you can get it from the texlive distribution. There may be
other things that this depends on. If you find one add it to the list.

## Usage

1. Edit things
2. type 'make'
3. commit your changes and push them. I think it makes sense to add the pdf to
   the repository so that we don't have to pull the code, and generate the pdf
   just to review someones changes.
